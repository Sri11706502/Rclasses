variable assignment
  -equal operator(=)
  -left assignment operator(<-)
  -right assignment operator(->)
  
Variable declaration
  -declared with the help of letters, dot and underscore
  -can start with a underscore not followed by a number
  
Quotient : %/%
Remainder : %%

&& :  used to compare the first element of the vector and return true if both are true
|| :  used to compare the first element of the vector and return true if any one is true

Logical operators : <,>,<=,>=,==,!=

Assignment operators :
  -Left assignment : <- , <<- , =
  -Right assignment : -> , ->>
  
colon operator
  -prints a continous list of numbers from start to end (either side of colon)
  
%in% operation
  - used to check whether a number lies in the list of another variable
  -eg : v16<-2:8
        v17<-5
        print(v17 %in% v16)
      Output : TRUE as 5 exists in 2:8
      
Defining a Matrix :
  -M= matrix(c(2,3,4,5,6,7),nrow=2,ncol=3,byrow = TRUE)
  
Defining a transpose of a Matrix
  -t(M) where M is the Matrix
  
%*% operation
  - used to define the multiplication between two matrices
  
vectors
  most basic r objects
  
creating a vector
  Single element vector
    -print("hello")
    -print(34.6)
    -print(45L)
  Multiple element vector
    -c<-2:8
    -print(c)
    
Sequence operation
  -seq(5,25, by=5)

Using the c function
  -used to assign numberings to the list
  
Sorting
  -sorting can be done with the help of the sort() function
  -sorting is done in dictionary order and is not based on ASCII codes

Lists in R
